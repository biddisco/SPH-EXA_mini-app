MERGE JENKINS: DONE

ADD OPTIONS

REMOVE MOST TEMPLATES:
- remove templates by putting precision and vector into a config.hpp file

MPI IO INSTEAD OF GATHER/SCATTER

BEING TO SORT PARTICLES AND REPLACE HALO EASILY
- tree contains a copy of the box, x, y, z and returns an ordering
- cells are then sorted according to the ordering (add reorder method in the tree)
- keep current start and count mechanisms in tree
- go through tree recursively for:
	- assign ranks
	- find haloCells
	- if rank not us and cell is halo, mpi recv asynch with pointer to this part of the data (the start)

ADD OpenACC
